alias: Mites
title: ICTV Master Species List (MSL)
description: |-
  The aim is to give a overview to the group starting with Linnaeus 1758 and continues till now. 
  Recently the tables contain more than 58.000 species-names, 7.000 genus-names, and 30.000 papers, chapters and books.
  
  This data-base is a compilation of all named mites and ticks, but doesn't claim to be complete. 
  I focus mainly to systematic and nomeclature. 
  Ecological, faunistical, veterinary, medical, phylogenetic, anatomical, and all the other topics take into consideration too. 
  Almost every day the list is treated.Sometimes the fields aren't complete but this goal is aspired.
