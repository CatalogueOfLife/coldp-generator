title: List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature
description: |-
  The List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) was established in 1997 by Professor Jean Euzéby as the List of Bacterial names with Standing in Nomenclature (LBSN). 
  Launched on 28 March 1997 as anonymous ftp files and on the World Wide Web on 28 January 1998, 
  ‘Euzéby’s List’ rapidly became a key online resource for anyone interested in bacterial and archaeal nomenclature and classification; 
  it changed ownership to Aidan C. Parte in July 2013 upon Euzéby’s retirement.
  
  The LPSN has remained an invaluable resource for keeping abreast of the rapid changes in prokaryotic nomenclature and ever-increasing descriptions of novel taxa. 
  The number of new prokaryotic names and new combinations validly published according to the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) has exploded over the last three decades, and is set to continue increasing, irrespective of future modifications to the Code.
  
  With the rise in actual and anticipated new prokaryotic names, the LPSN had become increasingly difficult to maintain, so a better technical and funding basis was sought. 
  To that end, in November 2019, the LPSN was acquired by Leibniz Institute DSMZ – German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH, Germany. 
  The DSMZ already had its Prokaryotic Nomenclature Up-to-date (PNU) service since 1993, and because there is significant overlap in the content of both sites, it was decided to merge the two services into a completely new one, still under the LPSN name, which has a higher profile in the community. On 17 February 2020, the new LPSN was launched at https://lpsn.dsmz.de/ under a modified Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.
