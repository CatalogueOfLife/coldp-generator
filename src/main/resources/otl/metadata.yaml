title: Open Tree of Life Synthetic Tree
description: |-
  Open Tree of Life aims to construct a comprehensive, dynamic and digitally-available tree of life 
  by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees along with taxonomic data. 
  The project is a collaborative effort between 11 PIs across 10 institutions. 
  Funded by NSF ABI #1759838, NSF AVAToL #1208809. More information and tutorials at opentreeoflife.org
