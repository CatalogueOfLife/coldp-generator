title: The Mammal Diversity Database
description: |-
  The Mammal Diversity Database (MDD), originally released in 2018, aims to provide a continuously updated listing of the world’s mammal species 
  and higher taxa (all ranks above the species level). 
  The primary goal of the MDD is to centralize information regarding the most recent and reliable systematic publications for each clade, 
  offering up the taxonomic consequences of those works with a limited amount of subjective curation on behalf of the MDD Team. 
  Foremost, the MDD aims to adhere to open science principles by providing streamlined access to the compiled data from our taxonomic curation efforts.

  The MDD includes webpages for each species of currently recognized mammals, including taxonomic comments regarding changes 
  since the Mammals Species of the World, 3rd Edition (MSW3; (Wilson and Reeder 2005)), and fields for type locality, higher-level taxonomy, 
  common names, and updated country-level distributions. More fields of information are available in the download of the MDD (ZIP archive with CSV database & metadata). 
  Some species currently also include the original name combination as spelled in the original taxonomic description of that species, 
  original description citations, links to those publications, holotype voucher specimens, and nominal synonyms in a format similar to MSW3. 
  This information is still a work in progress and is primarily under manual curation, so errors of omission or orthography may still be present. 
  The MDD Team is also working on systematically curating synonyms from large publications such as the Mammals of South America 
  and the Taxonomy of Australian Mammals, for which future updates will include compiled information. 
  Subspecies have not yet been addressed here due to their inconsistent historical usages in mammalogy, although future efforts 
  are likely to compile subspecies information for the purposes of species-level synonymy. 
  The MDD is being regularly updated, so users are encouraged to contact the MDD team to report errors, new taxonomic arrangements, 
  or queries regarding the taxonomy and interface via email.
  
  In situations of conflicting taxonomic arrangement in the recent literature, the MDD team has endeavored to provide justifications 
  and citations for the subjective decisions made, as well as a ‘flag’ designation in the CSV file. 
  If the reader finds additional situations or omitted evidence, we kindly request feedback (please use the email noted above). 
  The most substantial subjective decision the MDD has thus far encountered has been how to incorporate the recommendations 
  of Groves and Grubb (2011)’s compendium Ungulate Taxonomy. This taxonomy of Perissodactyla and non-cetacean Artiodactyla was fully included 
  in the initial release of the MDD (Burgin et al. 2018). However, since Groves and Grubb (2011) was based primarily on qualitative morphological diagnoses 
  with small sample sizes, it has since become controversial in the mammalogical community (e.g., (Holbrook 2013; Gutiérrez and Garbino 2018)). 
  Many specialists have subsequently reverted to the taxonomic arrangement presented by Peter Grubb in MSW3. 
  In current versions of the MDD, we use MSW3 as a baseline for ungulate taxonomy, leaving out all changes made by Groves and Grubb (2011) 
  with the exception of those supported by other published research.
