title: Open Tree of Life reference taxonomy
description: |-
  The Open Tree of Life reference taxonomy is an algorithmic combination of several source taxonomies.
  
  Curated additions from the Open Tree amendments-1 repository as processed into https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/edOTTs up to commit 1281c6afa4fa504af4b2f47d9965d16f6e1067d6 These taxa are added during OTU mapping using the curator application.
